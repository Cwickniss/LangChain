# LangChain for Generative AI Pipelines

### Code and slides to accompany the online series of webinars: https://data4sci.com/langchain by Data For Science.


LangChain is the state-of-the-art framework for developing Large Language Model (LLM) based applications. It provides a wide range of Lego-like components to streamline the integration of various LLM functionalities into functional pipelines without requiring in-depth expertise in ML.

In this course, students will get an in-depth view of the structure of LangChain and its various components. You will learn how to apply these components to Information Retrieval and the development of chatbots. An overview of the pros and cons of LLMs from OpenAI, HuggingFace, and Anthropic, as well as a primer on Prompt Engineering, will also be provided to empower students to make the best use possible of the capabilities that LangChain puts at their fingertips.
